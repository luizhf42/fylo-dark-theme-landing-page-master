## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I made a first try with the mobile-first workflow in this project. Furthermore, all the other technologies and features were used before, so nothing new for me.

### Continued development

I appreciated using the mobile-first workflow, so I will keep focusing on using it. Also, CSS Grid has helped me a lot and I will deepen in this too.

### Useful resources
